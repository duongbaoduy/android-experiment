To make reading of this page more valuable (for future search results) I made a list of libraries known to me.. As @CommonsWare mentioned there are super-similar questions/answers.. Anyway some libraries that can be used for making charts are:

Open Source:

	Holo Graph Library
	aChartEngine
	ChartView
	aFreeChart
	ChartDroid
	charts4j
	GraphView
	AndroidPlot
	Drawing the 3D piechart Using Google chart Api
	MPAndroidChart
	WilliamChart
	HelloCharts
	
Paid:

	aiCharts
	RChart (pre Honeycomb - Api 11 UI)
	ShinobiControls **
	Steema TeeChart **
	Orson Charts (3D charts for Android)
	Telerik Rad Chart
	
** - means I didn't try those so I can't really recommend it but other users suggested it..

Hope you and others will find it useful.. Cheers ;)

p.s. please don't add new libs on top or reorder the list. Thanks
